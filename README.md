Project Brief

Housing prices have always been a topic for everyone living in sydney since the early 2000. Many government reforms have inflated the housing bubble causing the price of houses to ever rise. The outbreak of coronavirus changed the lives of many and taught individuals to adapt to change. The purpose of this project is to analyse the house price inflation during and after the effects of coronavirus.

The overall project will assess the various changes in house prices and how they have been affected from the outbreak of coronavirus. With many fluctuations in population and travel being limited in many areas of the state of NSW. It will create a story which can be visualised through graphical representations of data.

Our goal is to represent the data that has already been collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics during the epidemic and visualise it. The data will be broken down into its simplest form and from there built upon itself. Four open ended questions are provided in this document, which allow for the extensive exploration of the data we have collected. These questions will analyse some of the most critical decisions made by the people of NSW and how coronavirus has affected the prices of houses NSW, especially Sydney.
